title: Easter Bunny

This Sunday is Easter, so I thought I'd do an <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/easter/index.html" target="_blank">Creepy Easter Bunny</a> project! Click on the creepy bunny until he disappears, he'll try to get you to stop but don't listen to him!

To do this project I created a function that would make the bunny get smaller with each click, say something every 6 clicks, and disappear after 58 clicks. I used parseInt to take a string like 100px and get the numeric value from it so that I could subtract by 1 and then added the string value "px". I also learned to use a counter and got more experience with flexbox.

Hope you have a good Easter!
