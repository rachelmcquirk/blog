My <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/prettyquiz/index.html' target='_blank'>"What kind of vacation should you go on?"</a> quiz is complete! You should definitely take it now. You'll notice that it looks pretty much like a Buzzfeed quiz.

Some of the issues that came up with the CSS were small, like figuring out why certain elements weren't aligning correctly or how to center the question text in the div. I'm very happy with the way it looks - doing this has definitely helped me get more familiar with CSS. Making the checked box's background color stay blue was one of the most challenging problems which I thought would be easy to do with CSS. It turned out to be more complex and required JavaScript. I ended up asking my awesome programmer boyfriend for help when I couldn't figure it out myself. He walked me through the solution which taught me about focus, blur, and change events. I'll probably work on making this quiz mobile over the weekend.

Enjoy!
