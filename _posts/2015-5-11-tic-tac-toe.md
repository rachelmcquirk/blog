Yay, I'm finally back to making projects! I actually missed JavaScript. The site I was working on still isn't up and running as I am waiting for more information that they want me to add but I'll post it as soon as it is!

Today I made a two-player <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/tictactoe' target='_blank'>tic-tac-toe</a> game to ease back into things. I started out thinking of an easy (but messy) solution when checking for a win but decided I wanted one that was more elegant. This did not happen, a lot of what I found through my searches were the same solution I had come up with so I had to stick with my original plan. I'm not super proud of this code as it is very messy but at least it works!
