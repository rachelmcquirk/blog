title: Making Music
---
I found some cool project ideas through <a href="http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/" target="_blank">Coder Projects</a> and decided to do their Music Boxes project. I've called mine, <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/makingmusic" target="_blank">"Making Music"</a>.

I've been wanting to do something with audio clips and now I know how! This is also my fist project using jQuery, it's pretty handy. I had two options of interactions to make the squares play the note 1) user clicks on square (using mousedown) or 2) user rolls over square (mouseover). Both were pretty cool but I stuck with mousedown. I also picked up a few other little skills like changing the mouse pointer into a hand and the currentTime property which allows me to turn back to a certain time in the media file when the square is clicked again.
