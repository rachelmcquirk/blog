title: Memory Game
---
Today I've made an adorable <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/memory' target='_blank'>memory game</a>! This was a pretty fun project - lots of challenges and new insights into JavaScript. I learned how to use self-executing anonymous functions and the setTimeout() method and how to shuffle an array of objects.

I feel that to fully comprehend these things and have them engrained I need to use them continuously so I'm going to try and figure out some projects that will use a lot of the same elements.

I hope you enjoy the game! :)
