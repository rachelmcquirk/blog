title: Typing Test
---
Today's project is a simple <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/typingtest' target='_blank'>typing test</a>. In order to check if the words in the textbox match those in the actual paragraph I created separate arrays of the words using the split method.

It will count the words that match the words of the paragraph at each step, so be careful of mistakes! Try it out and see how many words you can get in a minute. I must admit, I carelessly picked difficult paragraphs from Wikipedia so this isn't super accurate ;)
