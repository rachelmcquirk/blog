Yay, I'm back to my normal schedule! There was a lot going on last month but I'm glad to be focused on my projects again.

Today I made a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/hangman' target='_blank'>Hangman game</a> to refresh myself with JavaScript before my bigger projects. Take a look, I think it turned out pretty good!
