title: Hello World!

I’m starting this blog to track my progress as I learn how to program. My goal is to do a project every weekday and post about it, using weekend time to work on polishing the appearance of projects. You can follow along and find all of my projects listed <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/index.html' target="_blank">here</a>.

I was inspired to do these projects/blog posts after learning about <a href='http://jenniferdewalt.com/' target="_blank">Jennifer Dewalt’s projects</a> – she did a project every single day and learned how to program! Like her, my background is not in CS, I’m actually a Psychology grad from the University of Texas. Not long after graduating and moving to San Francisco I found my interest in the tech industry and I’d like to see where this takes me.

I’m late to the blog and have already created 3 projects but from now on I’ll be posting each project the day of.

### Project 1

My first project was my <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/' target="_blank">homepage</a>. Things are pretty basic right now but, nevertheless, I’m happy with how it turned out - I’ll add more to it as I learn new skills.

###Project 2
Project 2 was a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/madlib/index.html' target="_blank">Madlib</a>. I had a lot of fun with this one! It was the first time I got to put my JavaScript skills into use. Try it out, maybe you’ll create a madlib that actually makes sense!

###Project 3
Project 3 is a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/colorgenerator/index.html' target="_blank">Random Pretty Color Generator</a>. I wondered, “How can I make this different than other random color generators?” There are a large variety of colors that can be randomly selected (grays and browns included) and I decided that I wanted get rid of these “ugly” colors. I googled and found this <a href='https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor' target='_blank'>awesome script</a> that does exactly what I wanted! I added this to my code which taught me how to use a library. I also learned the code for a normal color generator (without the fancy stuff). And here it is, short and sweet: ‘#’ +Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16); What that does is it takes a random number between 0 and FFFFFF (the largest 6-digit hex number) and converts it to hex (base-16).

I’ve been having a lot of fun with these ideas so far and I’m looking forward to next week’s projects!
