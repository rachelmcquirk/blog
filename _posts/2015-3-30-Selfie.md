title: Selfie Place

It's <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/prettyquiz/index.html" target="_blank">selfie time</a>! My latest project made it so that you can access your webcam from a browser, take a picture and then upload it to imgur so you can share your awesome selfie with everyone.

Adding the webcam access was pretty simple. I had a tougher time figuring out issues with getting a screenshot - what I ended up doing was saving the image to a canvas and then adding the image url into a div. In order to upload the image to imgur I needed to sign up and add their API, then I used jQuery to handle the AJAX request.

No duck faces, please. ;)
