title: Screenshots

I've decided that my project page is in need of a makeover so today I planned a new layout and took a bunch of screenshots of my finished projects. Initially I tried to use a couple of services that would take the screenshots of my project pages for me but their free plans were too limited for what I needed. At least I learned more about documentation and how to use APIs.

It doesn't make sense for me to post the link today since the one I post tomorrow will be the same link, thus updating anything I post today.
