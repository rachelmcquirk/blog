title: Text Scroll
---
I had a lot of fun with Today's project! This is another idea I got from <a href='http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com' target='_blank'>Jennifer Dewalt's projects</a> and it ended up working differently than I had originally anticipated. The project is a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/textscroll/' target='_blank'>text-scroller</a>, you type something up and press enter and the words appear scrolling below in a random color and with a random scroll speed.

I ran into some issues using a div as the container for the text inputs and ended up using canvas, which I didn't know too much about before. So lots of canvas learning going on and this project got me more focused on tiny, detail-oriented things. For example, near the end I had everything working and then I noticed when I added right to left text scrolling, the word would just disappear when it touched 0 on the x-axis rather than the word scrolling off to the left letter by letter. There were lots of little things like that, it was great to get me thinking more about all of the little bugs.
