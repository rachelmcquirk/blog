title: Color Squares
---
Last week I re-did a few of my older projects using React and today I made a new one called <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/colorsquares' target='_blank'>Color Squares</a>. It's a simple project that changes the background color each time you click and records the number of clicks while adding a div of the present random color. This has really helped me learn the framework better and feel more comfortable using it. I'm sure it's a piece of cake to understand for those who have been programming and using frameworks for years but as a beginner I had to wrap my mind around a different way of doing things.

Other than that I also spent some time watching youtube videos about Material Design, which was very interesting.
