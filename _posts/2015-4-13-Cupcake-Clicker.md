title: Cupcake Clicker
---
 Have you ever played that ridiculously addicting game <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">"Cookie Clicker"</a>? Well today I've started my own <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/cupcakeclicker" target="_blank">Cupcake Clicker</a> game. It won't be nearly as in-depth but I thought it would be fun to try and replicate parts of it. Right now all you're able to do is click on the cupcake and have it show how many cupcakes you've made (1 cupcake per click). There is the shop but right now it doesn't actually do anything - I'll be working on the JS for that tomorrow.
