This week is going to be off in terms of my normal programming schedule. I have volunteered to create a website for the Austin Council of the Blind so that will take up a good bit of time trying to figure out the layout and what they need/want on it as communication is slow. In addition to that I have a meetup and company coming on Wednesday and leaving on Saturday. Today I started organizing the site and the plan is to work on it some more tomorrow and over the weekend. I’m counting this as one of my projects and I’ll post it as soon as it’s live!
