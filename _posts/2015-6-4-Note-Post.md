Tuesday I decided it was time to reformat my computer, it had been much too slow for me to work with while coding. It definitely took a while wiping everything out and reinstalling all of my programs plus the ridiculous number of Windows updates.

On Wednesday I spent time researching UI/UX design to see if that would be something I would like to learn/look into as well. This came about when I realized how much I love making websites and . I also looked into some programming internships to see where I need to be and what people do/learn during an internship.

Today I created a page where users can <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/notepost' target='_blank'>post notes</a>! The 3 most recent posts are all that show so I learned how to pop and unshift arrays as well as worked more with Firebase.
