title: New Project Page

Here's the new and improved <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/" target="_blank">project page</a>. I found a <a href="https://github.com/gudh/ihover" target="_blank">library</a> for the hover effects, there are so many options! I'll need to do a project using CSS animations to learn how to do it myself. I used JavaScript in order to add new projects easily and have them line up accordingly versus modifying the html file every day.

It feels really good to update this page as it was very basic before.

You can see the old version below:
