title: Grid Puzzle
---
I haven't posted for the past few days because this project I just finished had some more intense things for me to wrap my head around and ended up taking 3 days. It's a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/gridpuzzle' target='_blank'>grid puzzle</a>! I really enjoy doing grid puzzles so while I was doing one, the thought occurred that it would be a great idea to program one and make it interactive. In order to complete the puzzle, you must  have the correct answers in the grid as well as answer the question correctly. Surprisingly the hardest part of this project was making the "dropdown list" from scratch and associating the words with their pictures.

I feel that I've learned quite a bit more about how JavaScript works and this is by far my favorite project! I hope to create more projects that have to do with puzzles :).
