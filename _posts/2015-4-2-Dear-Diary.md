title: Dear Diary

Today I learned how to store things locally with JavaScript. My <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/deardiary/index.html" target="_blank">"Dear Diary"</a> project allows anyone to write about their day and save it forever by pressing the save entry button. Don't worry, no one will see your secrets but you...unless someone is snooping on your device. 

I'm thinking I might end up adding onto this project so that you can make multiple entries and archive them. We'll see.
