My first post this week! Late I know. I've redone my home page and added a navigation bar to my project and blog pages! Thus I will not link to it but I have included before and after shots. I've been meaning to redo it for while now and I'm so glad I finally did! It feels fresh and more up to date with where I am in terms of HTML and CSS knowledge.

One of my very good friends is coming to stay with me to explore SF, so I will not be writing any posts next week.

Here it is, this is the first homepage (and my first project).

It looks a lot better now!
