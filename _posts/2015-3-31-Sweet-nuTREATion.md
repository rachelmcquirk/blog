I got to play around with bootstrap today! Bootstrap is a framework that makes styling beautiful websites easier, it also helps with scaling your site to mobile. Today, I've created a website for a fake business, <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/sweet/home.html' target='_blank'>"Sweet nuTREATion"<a>. Just thought I'd make up some content for an imaginative idea. I'll continue working on this tomorrow so that I can learn more about this awesome framework.
