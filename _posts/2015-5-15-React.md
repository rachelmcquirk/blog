title: Learning about React
---
Today and yesterday I spent my time looking into React, a JavaScript framework. React uses a virtual DOM implementation which allows changes to the DOM to be rendered faster. It's also easier and more efficient than using plain JS to go in and manipulate the DOM.

I played around with some demo code to get a better grasp of it and intend to use React for one of my projects next week.
