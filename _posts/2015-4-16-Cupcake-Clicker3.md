title: Part 3 - Cupcake Clicker
---
Check out the final version of my <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/cupcakeclicker3" target="_blank">Cupcake Clicker</a>! I've added a new section telling the user how many cupcakes each of their upgrades are making per second. There's also a newsfeed that displays random things about the business based on the amount of progression in their game. In addition to that I changed up the shop structure to have variable costs - so the cost of the items go up the more you buy, otherwise it would be too easy ;).

I hope you create a successful cupcake empire!
