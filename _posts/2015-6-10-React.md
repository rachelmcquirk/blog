title: React-Die project
---
I finally did something with React! I took my die project and cleaned it up using React, the code looks so much better. I'll do this again tomorrow with another one of my old projects to get a better hang of it and then create something new.

I've pushed the revised die project but didn't put it on my projects page as nothing has changed other than the code.
