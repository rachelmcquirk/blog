title: A working Quiz
---
Yay, I have a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/workingquiz/index.html'>working quiz</a> now! I recommend waiting until the next post to try it out though, I still need to work on the content that shows up for the result ;). The plan for tomorrow is to make it look pretty and fine-tune things.

The most difficult task was finding a way to grab the quiz category with the highest number of checks. I wasn't able to come up with it on my own and had to search for a solution. I was able to break it down and learned about the apply method and math.max function. Check back tomorrow for the finished product!
