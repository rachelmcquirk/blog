It blanked on me yesterday to write a post as I was busy making changes to the website I'm doing for the Austin Council of the Blind and getting it pushed out - this was my first experience with FTP. You can check out the finished project <a href='http://www.acbaustin.org/' target='_blank'>here</a>. Setting up the site was pretty simple, the hard part was tracking down information and figuring out what they wanted/needed for the site. I'm glad I could set them up with a solid website! For reference, here is their <a href='http://www.acbtexas.org/' target='_blank'>*old* site</a>.

Yesterday and today I worked on a <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/horoscope2' target='_blank'>daily horoscope</a> project. This was a great project for getting more experienced with AJAX requests, this time I used vanilla JavaScript rather than JQuery to grab the information for the horoscopes.
