title: Let's Make a Deal
---
Today I made a game that is similar to the game show "Let's Make a Deal". On the show the contestant has to choose from 3 doors, one contains a car and the other two contain goats. The contestant chooses one door and then the host reveals one of the doors containing a goat. He then allows the contestant the choice to switch doors.

Much like the show, in <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/letsmakeadeal/index.html' target='_blank'>my game</a> you're given 3 doors - one of which contains something awesome. After a door is chosen I reveal one of the doors that contains something cringeworthy and you are given the choice to switch doors. You may think that the probability of getting the awesome thing is the same whether you switch doors or not but this is not true! So, which choice is more advantageous? This brain teaser is called the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability paradox. If you can't figure it out, watch <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0' target='_blank'>this video</a> for an explanation or check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" target='_blank'>wikipedia page</a>.

Credit to Jennifer Dewalt for this awesome <a href='http://jenniferdewalt.com/make_a_deal.html' target="_blank">project idea</a>! I chose to improve upon it by using JavaScript rather than HTML. In addition to working more with JavaScript I learned how to remove an event listener. Wooh hoo!

Enjoy the game, y'all!
