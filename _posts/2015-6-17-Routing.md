title: Routing
---
Today I added a component to my color squares project. This required me to set up a router in React that switches between components. The component I added today was completely arbitrary, I only did it to learn about switching between components. But if you're interested it's just a text area for typing and the text changes colors with each key press.

Learning this will help me with more complex projects that will span multiple pages.
