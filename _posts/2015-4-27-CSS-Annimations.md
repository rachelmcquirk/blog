title: CSS Animations
---
Today was pretty low-key on the programming end. I wanted to learn how to do CSS animations myself after using a library for them for my projects page. I decided to make a site with <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/animations' target='_blank'>my favorite tv shows</a> to add some interesting content. The transitions are pretty simple for now.

Have a look and see if your inspired to binge watch a new amazing show!
