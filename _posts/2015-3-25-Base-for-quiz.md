title: Base for Quiz
---
Today was less productive as I ran into my first big code blocks and deciding where to start with my quiz. I've decided to break this project down so today I just have the base of a quiz. So far I've made it so that the quiz spits back the category of your answers.

You can try it out <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/partonequiz/index.html' target='_blank'>here</a> but beware, it's pretty ugly and doesn't really make sense in its current stage - I'm just posting it to show progress. Check back tomorrow for an improved version, though I don't expect this project to be fully done until Monday. Today I've learned how to iterate over an object and how to work with radio inputs. Also that patience is critical as a developer.
