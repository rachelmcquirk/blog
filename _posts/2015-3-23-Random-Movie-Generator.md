title: Random Movie Generator
---
Having trouble finding a movie? Check out my awesome <a href='http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/moviegenerator/index.html' target='_blank'>random movie generator</a>! It includes 13 of my favorite movies, you'll find that they all have pretty high IMDb ratings - no bad flicks here!

For this project I learned how to make a lightbox, viewing trailers is so much better without having the browser take you to a different page. In addition - on the JavaScript side of things - I got more familiar with using objects inside of arrays and event listeners (anonymous functions). I also worked with more CSS properties such as hover and active states.

Hope you enjoy!
