title: Digital Clock
---
Today's creation is a simple <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/digitalclock" target="_blank">digital clock</a>. I took this project idea from Coder Projects and added a random color element to it. The background color changes every minute and returns to you the hex code for that color. I'm reusing the library from my pretty colors project to get the random color.

I learned about the date object and how to extract certain elements from it. Javascript reads 6:03 like 18 hours, 3 minutes so I gained more problem solving experience figuring out how to change change 24-hour time to 12-hour and add those pretty zeros in for placeholders.
