title: Dear Diary (Firebase)
---
I've taken my <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/deardiaryfirebase" target="_blank">Dear Diary</a> project and made it so that it stores data using Firebase as a backend rather than storing it locally. It saves the data globally, so anytime anyone edits it, it shows the new text for everyone.

I spent a good chunk of my time just learning about Firebase. There's a lot of neat things I could do using Firebase like adding user accounts but I think I'll save that for later as I work my way toward more advanced subjects.
