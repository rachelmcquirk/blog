title: Part 2 - Cupcake Clicker
---
 My <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/cupcakeclicker2" target="_blank">Cupcake Clicker</a> shop works now! Today I focused on getting the shop to work as well as saving an object to local storage using JSON.Stringify. Tomorrow I'll work on showing users how many cupcakes the items are adding per second, scaling the cost based on the number of items you have and whatever else I can come up with.
