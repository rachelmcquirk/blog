title: Roll the Die
---
Outside of programming my boyfriend and I have been working on a board game called "Hip Hip Hipster" - it's a spin-off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Pretty_Princess" target="_blank">"Pretty Pretty Princess"</a>. I realized that we need a die for the game but we don't actually have one so I thought it would be cool to make my own! Now when we play I can pull up my <a href="http://rachelmcquirk.com/projects/die" target="_blank">Roll the Die</a> project!
